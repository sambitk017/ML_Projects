Inititalize a env 
python -m venv myenv

Activate the env 
myenv\scripts\Activate

Inititalize a git repo
git Init

for the first time we have to set it to global
git config --global user.name "Sambit"
git config --global user.email sambitk017@gmail.com

add the readme file 
git add read me file 

commit the file changes
git commit -m "the message"

go to the master branch 
git branch -M main

checkout to the repo 
git remote add origin {link}

push the changes 
git push -u origin main

Create a git ignore file for the specific language
for checking and ignore some specific items or packages while the build 

Create a setup.py and a requirements.txt
In setup.py add the details 

in requirements.txt add all the packages you want to install

then create a src file where you create a init folder 
to demonstrate it as a package, when the find packages() runs in setup.py


make sure to add '-e .' at the end of the requiremtns.txt file to run the setup.py file 


PROJECT STRUCTURE
Inside src file 
--> create a folder for components , which has the major parts of the projects
    such as data ingestion, transformation, model_trainer etc

--> create a folder as pipeline
